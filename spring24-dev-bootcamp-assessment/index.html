      <p>Hi there! My name is Jade Chiban, I am a third year Computer Science Major with a focus in Media and Devices. I am a Atlanta local dedicated to uplifting my community and creating change on a local level.
         I volunteer with several nonprofits based in Atlanta including Change to Humanity, Friends of South Bend Park Restoration, and Trees Atlanta. Change to Humanity tackles food insecurity in low-income neighborhoods that are often in food deserts. 
         While at Friends of South Bend, we focus on reenforcing our old growth forests by planting native species and removing harmful invasives. I believe Bits for Good would give me to platform to help enact more social good.     </p>
